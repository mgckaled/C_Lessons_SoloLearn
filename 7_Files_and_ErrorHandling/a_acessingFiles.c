/*An external file can be opened, read from, and written to in a C program. 
For these operations, C includes the FILE type for defining a file stream. 
The file stream keeps track of where reading and writing last occurred.

The stdio.h library includes file handling functions:
FILE Typedef for defining a file pointer.

fopen(filename, mode) Returns a FILE pointer to file filename which is 
opened using mode. If a file cannot be opened, NULL is returned.
Mode options are:
- r open for reading (file must exist)
- w open for writing (file need not exist)
- a open for append (file need not exist)
- r+ open for reading and writing from beginning
- w+ open for reading and writing, overwriting file
- a+ open for reading and writing, appending to file

fclose(fp) Closes file opened with FILE fp, returning 0 if close was successful.
EOF (end of file) is returned if there is an error in closing.
